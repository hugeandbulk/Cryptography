## checksum
_A checksum is a value that represents the number of bits in a transmission message and is used by IT professionals to detect high-level errors within data transmissions. Prior to transmission, every piece of data or file can be assigned a checksum value after running a cryptographic hash function_.

_Checksum is the redundant bits that are attached with actual data. Sometimes, a Checksum is also considered as a hash sum or hash value. On the sender's side, this method uses a checksum generator to generate a Checksum. On the receiving end, a checksum checker is used to validate whether the correct data is received_.
